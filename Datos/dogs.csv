My name is Gouzi and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by my previous owner on February 10, 2022 because they were moving out of country and could not bring me with. I lived in a home with adults only and have not been socialized with children or other animals. My previous owner described me as energetic and alert.<p/><p/>I am a very smart dog! At the shelter I am practicing how to ""sit"".<p/><p/>I am full of energy and I love to play! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy.<p/><p/>My caregivers have observed that I might not get along with other dogs. I may do best as the only dog in my new home, or I may need a very slow introduction to other dogs.<p/><p/>Because of my shy nature, I would do best in a calm, quiet home.<p/><p/>My personality color is BLUE. I am a gentle and loving dog who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might take some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/>",BLUE

I have also lived in a home with other cats and i do well with them. <p/><p/>Because I have skin issues, I have been medicated frequently and now I am a little sensitive when people try to touch my head.

I am a spirited cat with a fun-loving personality! I may be sensitive to handling, so I would do best in a home with a cat savvy family who knows when to give me some space.<p/><p/>",RED

I am an adaptable cat who loves to go with the flow! I am outgoing and carefree, and I just can't wait to find my forever home!<p/><p/>Current medical conditions are noted below.<p/><p/>1)   FeLV - This cat tested positive for Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV).  Cats infected with this virus may have an active, or latent infection.  Active infection leads to immunosuppression, increased susceptibility to disease, or lymphosarcoma.  Infected cats are expected to have a decreased lifespan and will require additional veterinary care.  However, with care, these cat may have a good quality of life for months to years.  FeLV is transmitted to other cats through saliva and activities such as sharing water bowls, communal grooming and social contact.  For this reason, this cat should be kept as a single cat or with other FeLV positive cats.  Please consult with your regular veterinarian for additional information and a management plan for your new pet.<p/><p/>2)  FIV - This cat tested positive for Feline Immunodeficiency Virus. This test is not always accurate in cats under 6 months of age and may be a false positive. Retesting after 6 months of age is recommeneded.<p/><p/>FIV can cause immunosuppression and susceptibility to other diseases.  Symptoms are varied but may include fever, anorexia, weight loss, or stomatitis.  Not all infected cats will become ill, and those that do may be healthy for weeks to years before illness.  Cats infected with FIV will remain infected for life and can spread the virus to other cats, usually through bite wounds.  For this reason, FIV cats should be kept indoors only, and should only be housed with FIV positive cats or in situations where risk of transmission is unlikely.  Please consult with your regular veterinarian for additional information and a management plan for your new pet.<p/><p/><p/>",GREEN

I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/><p/>I was nominated as the Pet of the Week on February 1, 2022. This means that my adoption fee has been reduced. Please note that a pet license is a requirement and therefore a fee may be applied.

This means there is an abnormal heart sound when we listen to the heart.  In some animals, this can indicate heart disease.  However, other animals can have heart murmurs and never show any symptoms of heart disease.  We recommend that you follow up with your regular veterinarian.  Please see the handout for more information about this condition.<p/><p/>2)  This animal has been diagnosed as hyperthyroid.  This means that thyroid gland is producing an excess of hormones.  This disease can be easily managed with daily medication, radioactive iodine treatment or prescription diet.  Please follow up with you regular veterinarian to create a treatment plan.

My name is Spuds and I am available for adoption. I was brought in by a good Samaritan on 7/24/21. <p/>I was nominated as the Pet of the Week on September 14, 2021. This means that my adoption fee has been reduced. Please note that a pet license is a requirement and therefore a fee may be applied. This helps my safe return home should I become lost, and comes with additional benefits such as Vacation Pet Alert, Free Ride Home and more (visit our pet licensing page for more info)!<p/><p/>My adoption fee was paid for by a generous donor so that I can find my forever home even faster!<p/><p/>I am an affectionate lovebug who would be thrilled to cuddle up with you at home! I love humans who pet me and other kitties so I would make a great cat for any family!<p/><p/>My personality color is GREEN. I am an adaptable cat who loves to go with the flow! I am outgoing and carefree, and I just can't wait to find my forever home!<p/><p/>Current medical conditions are noted below.<p/><p/>1)  Very weak positive FeLV- Feline leukemia virus is transmitted to other cats through saliva and activities such as sharing water bowls, communal grooming and social contact.  Infection is lifelong and there is no cure.  Cats infected with feline leukemia virus typically live shorter lifespans, although with proper care and management, some cats can have a good quality of life.  Please refer to the information handout.<p/><p/>2)  This animal has been diagnosed with kidney disease.  This condition can be managed with special diets and medications.  Treatment will be lifelong.  Please follow up with your regular veterinarian for the best treatment plan.  We have also included a handout with more information on this disease.<p/><p/>",GREEN

At the shelter I am practicing how to ""sit"", ""come"", ""down"" and ""shake"".<p/><p/>I am an affectionate lovebug who would be thrilled to cuddle up with you at home!<p/><p/>I am full of energy and I love to play! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy.<p/><p/>My caregivers have noticed that I seem to do well with other large dogs. I am pretty enthusiastic when greeting and would like another dog friend with a similar play style. <p/><p/>I have been known to resource guard, meaning that I am displaying behavior that is intended to convince other dogs or humans to stay away from a particular treasure or ""resource."" The resource that I tend to guard is shoes, socks, etc... If you take me home you will benefit from in home guidance to help to manage and improve this behavior.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/>",RED

Causes may include previous injury or joint disease, or genetic predisposition. Treatment is focused on lifelong management of the disease, rather than a cure.  Maintaining a healthy weight and a moderate activity level is an important aspect of treatment.  Daily medication, nutritional supplements or alternative therapies may be recommended.  Please follow up with your regular veterinarian to formulate a treatment plan for your new pet.<p/><p/>2)  This animal has been diagnosed as hyperthyroid.  This means that thyroid gland is producing an excess of hormones.  This disease can be easily managed with daily medication, radioactive iodine treatment or prescription diet.

However, male mice typically cannot live together and will fight to the death if left together.<p/><p/>Mice live on average 2 years, but they sure do pack a lot of life into that short time frame! Mice are very playful and inquisitive and have the best chance to have a healthy life with adequate care.<p/><p/>Recommendations For a Healthy Life<p/><p/>Exercise Wheel: 8 inch Silent Spinner type wheel<p/><p/>Aquarium: We recommend that mice are housed in a 30 inch long aquarium with mesh lid for safety and to allow them to dig and burrow.<p/><p/>Bedding & Nesting Material: We recommend Carefresh bedding or Kaytee – Clean and Cozy bedding. Plain toilet tissue is great for packing nests and sleeping hide-aways. You can find all these on smile.amazon.com<p/><p/>Variety of food: In addition to Oxbow brand young rat and mouse food, mice can also have a variety of treats to keep their diet balanced. Mice enjoy cooked pasta, peas, hard boiled eggs, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and meal worms.<p/><p/>Additionally:<p/><p/>A water bottle<p/>A nesting or hide-away box (wood or plastic)<p/>Attention and handling daily<p/>A change in their habitat set up at least once a week.<p/>",BLUE

My name is Ariya and I am available for adoption. I was brought in by my previous owner on June 4, 2021 because my owner was not able to provide me cat. I lived in a home with another cat but the two of us did not get along. My previous owner described me as very affectionate with humans. I have spent a few months in a foster home and my foster parent confirmed that I get along with small dogs, but I do not like other cats at all. <p/><p/>I am very loving and love to sit on your lap when I'm done eating. I like to eat every 6-8 hours and cry when I'm hungry. I purr a lot and will run to my food each time. Sometimes I just want to be left alone and hide under furniture but if you call my name I'll come out for pets once I get to know you.  <p/><p/>I have piercing green eyes that are absolutely gorgeous! And my tail hangs over my back, making me a very unique gal!  I love to get lots and lots of pets and attention, but beware because I will occasionally give the friendly little love bite! I will try not to crunch too hard, as long as you promise to give me lots of treats ??<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited cat with a fun-loving personality! I may be sensitive to handling, so I would do best in a home with a cat savvy family who knows when to give me some space.<p/><p/>I have been diagnosed with Feline Leukemia Virus. FeLV is transmitted to other cats through saliva and activities such as sharing water bowls, communal grooming and social contact.  Infection is lifelong and there is no cure.  Cats infected with feline leukemia virus typically live shorter lifespans, although with proper care and management, some cats can have a good quality of life.  Please refer to the information handout.<p/><p/>My adoption fee has been paid for by a generous donor in order to help me to get adopted!<p/><p/>",RED
